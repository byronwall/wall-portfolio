HN Offline is a lightweight web app for reading Hacker News with a focus on the comment experience. It stores visited stories and comment threads locally so you can keep reading even when you’re disconnected.

## How it works

HN Offline is built as a SolidJS/Remix app with an “offline-first” approach:

- **Data sources**:
  - Uses the official Hacker News Firebase API to load story and comment details.
  - Uses Algolia’s Hacker News search to fetch the top “day” and “week” story lists.
- **Offline storage**:
  - A service worker + local storage are used to keep previously loaded stories and comment threads available offline.
  - Visited stories are stored locally so the UI can grey them out (and optionally hide already-read items).
- **Background refresh**:
  - The server periodically refreshes lists (front page more frequently) and only reloads a story’s comments when enough time has passed, avoiding unnecessary re-fetching.
- **Comment-focused UX**:
  - Threads are collapsible; collapse state is persisted locally so you can leave and come back without losing your place.
  - HN links inside comments are detected and loaded in-app so you can keep navigating comment threads.
  - Authors get consistent colors, with logic to reduce collisions within a thread.

## Highlights

- Mobile-friendly comment reading (including nicer rendering for code blocks)
- “Subway-style” connectors to clarify reply structure
- No login, posting, or analytics—just reading
