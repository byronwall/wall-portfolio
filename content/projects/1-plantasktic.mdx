Plantasktic is a full-stack task management app designed around hierarchical tasks (nesting to any depth) so you can break down big goals into a structure that’s easy to navigate and maintain.

## Interface

The UI focuses on a clean, modern workflow: quick task entry, nested task trees, and filtering views for focusing on what matters. (Screenshots coming soon.)

## How it works

Plantasktic is built as a modern Next.js app with a type-safe, database-backed API:

- **App framework**:
  - Next.js (App Router) for server-rendered pages and fast navigation.
- **Type-safe API**:
  - tRPC for end-to-end types between client and server.
- **Data & auth**:
  - Prisma for database access and schema management.
  - NextAuth.js for authentication.
- **UI**:
  - Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for a clean, consistent component system.

## Highlights

- Hierarchical tasks with parent/child relationships for structured planning
- Workspaces and projects to keep related work grouped
- Rich task details (status, priority, due dates, descriptions)
- Filtering-focused views for staying on track
