summary: "A fitness mapping website for runners and athletes"
---

Co-founded and developed a fitness mapping website that helped runners plan and track their routes. Created with Chandler Wall while at Purdue, the platform was born from our shared passion for running and a desire to improve upon existing fitness tracking solutions. This was in 2009, during the early days of smartphones, when MapMyRun was the primary competitor in this space.

The site operated for 3 years with two major updates, continuing development even after graduation and the start of our full-time careers.
