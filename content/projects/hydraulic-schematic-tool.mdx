summary: "An Electron-based application for hydraulic system visualization and analysis"
---

Developed an Electron-based application using React and TypeScript for hydraulic system visualization and analysis. This tool enables engineers to create and analyze complex hydraulic systems through an intuitive interface.

## Key Features

- User-defined schematics with drag-and-drop interface
- Complex logic and connectivity handling
- Real-time system simulation
- SVG-based visualization engine
- Component library for common hydraulic elements

## Technical Details

The application is built using:

- Electron for cross-platform desktop support
- React and TypeScript for the user interface
- Custom SVG rendering engine for schematics
- State management for complex component interactions
- Modular architecture for extensibility

## Impact

This tool has significantly improved the efficiency of hydraulic system design and analysis at Allison Transmission, reducing the time required for system validation and enabling rapid prototyping of new designs.
