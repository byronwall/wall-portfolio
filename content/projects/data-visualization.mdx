Developed a comprehensive data visualization platform that combines the power of D3.js with custom rendering optimizations for large datasets.

## Key Features

- High-performance rendering using SVG and Canvas
- Interactive charts with zoom, pan, and selection capabilities
- Custom chart types for engineering data
- Responsive design and dynamic resizing
- Configurable styling and theming

## Technical Implementation

- Built on D3.js for generating SVG elements
- Custom React components for easy integration
- Hybrid rendering approach:
  - SVG for interactive elements
  - Canvas where needed to maintain performance (scatter charts and parallel coordinates)
- TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability

## Impact

This visualization library has become a cornerstone of our data analysis platforms, enabling engineers to:

- Identify patterns in transmission testing data
- Analyze performance metrics in near real-time
- Make data-driven decisions quickly
- Share insights through interactive visualizations
