Developed a comprehensive data visualization library that combines the power of D3.js with custom rendering optimizations for large datasets. This library powers various engineering applications at Allison Transmission.

## Key Features

- High-performance rendering using SVG and Canvas
- Interactive charts with zoom, pan, and selection capabilities
- Custom chart types for engineering data
- Responsive design and dynamic resizing
- Real-time data updates
- Configurable styling and theming

## Technical Implementation

- Built on D3.js for powerful data transformations
- Custom React components for easy integration
- Hybrid rendering approach:
  - SVG for interactive elements
  - Canvas for high-density data
- TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability
- Modular architecture for extensibility

## Impact

This visualization library has become a cornerstone of our data analysis platforms, enabling engineers to:

- Identify patterns in transmission testing data
- Analyze performance metrics in real-time
- Make data-driven decisions quickly
- Share insights through interactive visualizations

## Performance Optimizations

- Implemented virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Used WebWorkers for heavy computations
- Optimized render cycles with React's virtual DOM
- Created efficient data structures for quick lookups
